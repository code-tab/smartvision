Description:
This project focuses on developing an algorithm for accurate detection and location of human faces within digital images. It also involves multi-label classification using artificial intelligence techniques. The system achieves a high accuracy rate of 98.2%.

Features:
- Accurate detection and location of human faces in digital images
- Multi-label classification for assigning multiple labels to input samples
- Utilizes the Clarifai-nodejs-grpc API for image analysis and processing
- Backend integration with a connected database for efficient data management

Requirements:
- Clarifai-nodejs-grpc API credentials
- Database credentials and connection details
- Node.js and Npm runtime environment

Usage:
1. Clone the project repository from [repository URL].
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the package.json file.
3. Set up the Clarifai-nodejs-grpc API credentials in the configuration file.
4. Configure the database(PSQL) connection details in the backend configuration file.
5. Run the application using the specified command or script.
6. Provide digital images as input to detect and locate human faces.
7. Evaluate the multi-label classification results for the input samples.
8. Adjust and fine-tune the algorithm parameters to further improve accuracy.
